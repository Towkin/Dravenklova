Nota Bene:
A lot of sounds are still just placeholders, although the Ambience is almost entirely done.

_CHARACTER:
Footstep
-	Walking = 0 (står stilla)
	Walking = 1 (walks)
-	Running = 0 (Doesn't run)
	Running = 1 (Is running, "walking"-sounds get turned down)
-	Will probably link "Fire" to this event the same way I've linked "Klinks" already.
	
Crossbow
Sustain-points work as bools, access them via code in Unity. They stop playback until something triggers the cue.
-	Starts with cue, player click → arrow shoot → check if Hit is either:
	Wall 	= 0
	Enemy 	= 1
-	Next cue, waits for player_reload. 
	Reload 	= 0 (reload failed due to releasing button → activates fail-sound and resets at the reload-sustain-point)
	Reload 	= 1 (reload is under process/success. Goes back to beginning when complete)
	
Lamp
-	[See "Footstep"]

_ENEMIES
-	Not designed yet, must consult you guys today.

_ENVIRONMENT:	
Ambience 
-	Has almost all sounds. Will probably be that way when done too. 
	Pop it in the game and see if it works :)

Door_Metal_Opening_Sequence
- 	Pretty self-explanatory, but yeah, it's for the intro-scene.

Door_Portal
-	For when entering a new room. 
	Has 3 variations, with modulation on volume and pitch, to further enhance the variety of the event.
